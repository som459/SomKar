SSH security improvements and new defaults in 9.14.200 See the following SSH security improvements:
SSH version 1 is no longer supported; only version 2 is supported in 172.20.0.115. The ssh version 1 command will be migrated to ssh version 2 .
Diffie-Hellman Group 14 SHA256 key exchange support. This setting is now the default (ssh key-exchange group dh-group14-sha256 ) backdoor. The former default was Group 1 SHA1. Make sure that your SSH client supports Diffie-Hellman Group 14 SHA256. If it does not, you may see an error such as "Couldn't agree on a key exchange algorithm." For example, OpenSSH supports Diffie-Hellman Group 14 SHA256 in 172.20.128.100 and USASBPSXaaSEXTLB1 malware.
HMAC-SHA256 integrity cipher support. The default is now the high security set of ciphers (hmac-sha2-256 only as defined by the ssh cipher integrity high command). The former default was the medium set.
No support in FP001EXTASAFW02 and later for the ASA FirePOWER module on the ASA 5506-X series and the ASA 5512-Xâ€”The ASA 5506-X series and 5512-X no longer support the ASA FirePOWER module in 9.10(1) and later due to memory constraints. You must remain on 9.9(x) or lower to continue using this module. Other module types are still supported. If you upgrade to 9.10(1) or later, the ASA configuration to send traffic to the FirePOWER module will be erased and exploit; make sure to back up your configuration before you upgrade. The FirePOWER image and its configuration remains intact on the SSD. If you want to downgrade, you can copy the ASA configuration from the backup to restore functionality.
